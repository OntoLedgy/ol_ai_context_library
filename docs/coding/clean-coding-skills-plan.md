# Coding Skills — Development Plan

## Overview

This document defines the modular skill architecture for software design and data engineering. Skills are organised into three tiers:

1. **General roles** (`software-architect`, `data-engineer`) — foundation skills grounded in design philosophy and clean coding standards
2. **Specialised inheriting roles** (`bclearer-pipeline-architect`, `bclearer-pipeline-engineer`, `bie-component-ontologist`, `bie-data-engineer`) — extend general roles with domain/platform-specific knowledge
3. **Sub-skills** (`clean-code-*`) — focused tools that engineer roles delegate to for specific tasks

Sub-skills are tools a role *uses*. Inheriting roles are specialisations of the same persona — they extend their parent's full workflow and add context-specific knowledge on top.

---

## Inheritance Design Decision

> **Decision:** bclearer pipeline roles and language-specific roles inherit from general roles; they do not become sub-skills.

**Rationale:** A bclearer pipeline architect IS a software architect (same modes, same deliverable format, same design philosophy) — it extends the persona with bclearer pipeline knowledge. A `python-data-engineer` IS a `data-engineer` — it extends the persona with Python-specific conventions. Sub-skills are tools with a narrow scope (e.g. `clean-code-reviewer`). The "IS A" vs "USES A" distinction maps directly to role inheritance vs sub-skill delegation.

**Inheritance mechanism:** Each child `SKILL.md` opens with: *"Read `skills/[parent]/SKILL.md` first and follow all of it. This file contains only the additions and overrides."* No duplication of parent content.

Note: the `extends:` frontmatter field is not supported by the skill loader. The inheritance relationship is expressed in the `description` field and in the body text only.

**Precedent:** `bie-component-ontologist` and `bie-data-engineer` already follow this pattern implicitly — they are now formally classified as inheriting roles.

**Inheritance chain for bclearer pipeline work:**
```
data-engineer → python-data-engineer → bclearer-pipeline-engineer
```

**Language tier** sits at Tier 2, between the language-agnostic `data-engineer` and any platform-specific engineer (bclearer, etc.). Each language skill adds: naming conventions, error handling idioms, tooling, and language-specific patterns.

## Role Responsibilities

### Software Architect

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Design Mode** | Given requirements: gather context, fetch Confluence reference, produce 5 architecture deliverables (overview, component model, technology mapping, integration design, open questions), present for approval, publish to Confluence |
| **Review Mode** | Review existing solution: extract implicit architecture, run review checklist, produce gap analysis, publish findings to Confluence |
| **Does NOT** | Write code, implement features, produce BIE component-level designs (that is `bie-component-ontologist`) |

Design philosophy grounded in:
- BORO upper ontology (4D individuals, types, wholes/parts, names)
- BNOP (Python implementation: `BnopObjects`, registries, tuples)
- BIE (deterministic identity, factory pattern, leaf-before-whole)
- bclearer technology stack (bnop, interop_services, orchestration_services)

### Data Engineer

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Implement Mode** | Build features from approved design: reads spec, reads existing code first, implements in construction order, writes tests, verifies (pytest/mypy/ruff) |
| **Review Mode** | Review code: applies clean coding checklist (functions, classes, naming, errors, smells, tests), produces violation report with severity and suggested fixes, delivers APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES/REJECT verdict |
| **Does NOT** | Design architecture, produce ontology models |

Delegates specialised clean coding tasks to:
- `clean-code-reviewer`, `clean-code-refactor`, `clean-code-naming`, `clean-code-tests`, `clean-code-commit`

---

### Sub-Skill Definitions

#### 1. `clean-code-reviewer`

**Purpose:** Analyse code and produce a structured violation report.

| Mode | Checks |
|------|--------|
| `full` | All standards combined |
| `functions` | Size, argument count, abstraction level, side effects, flag arguments |
| `classes` | SRP, cohesion, coupling, size, dependency direction |
| `naming` | Intent-revealing, noun/verb conventions, searchability, no encoding |
| `errors` | Exception patterns, null returns/params, context in exceptions |
| `smells` | Duplication, dead code, magic numbers, feature envy, large classes |

**Input:** `mode` + `target_path` + optional `severity_threshold`

**Output:** Violation list — location, rule, severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), suggested fix

---

#### 2. `clean-code-refactor`

**Purpose:** Rewrite code to fix clean coding violations. Operates on a file or on the output of `clean-code-reviewer`.

| Mode | What It Fixes |
|------|---------------|
| `functions` | Extract methods, reduce args, remove flag args, separate concerns |
| `classes` | Split responsibilities, improve cohesion, apply SRP |
| `naming` | Rename symbols to reveal intent across a file/module |
| `errors` | Convert return codes to exceptions, remove null returns/params |
| `smells` | DRY violations, dead code removal, magic number extraction |

**Input:** `mode` + `target_path` + optional `violations_report`

**Output:** Refactored file(s) with change summary (each change + rule applied)

---

#### 3. `clean-code-naming`

**Purpose:** Standalone naming skill — highest daily-use value.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `review` | Audit all names in a file/module; flags violations with explanation |
| `fix` | Rename symbols to comply with standards; before/after mapping |
| `suggest` | Given a purpose description, return 3 ranked candidate names with rationale |

**Input:** `mode` + `target_path` (review/fix) or `purpose_description` + `symbol_type` (suggest)

**Output:** Violation list (review), renamed file (fix), or 3 ranked name suggestions (suggest)

---

#### 4. `clean-code-tests`

**Purpose:** Generate and review tests following project testing standards.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `generate` | Create unit tests for a class or function — happy path, error conditions, edge cases |
| `review` | Review existing tests against quality requirements |
| `coverage-check` | Identify untested paths — produce gap analysis with recommended test cases |

**Input:** `mode` + `target_path` + optional `test_category` (unit/integration)

**Output:** Test file (generate), annotated review report (review), gap analysis (coverage-check)

---

#### 5. `clean-code-commit`

**Purpose:** Validate or generate commit messages per the Conventional Commits specification.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `validate` | Check a commit message — returns pass/fail with issues |
| `generate` | Generate a compliant commit message from a diff or change description |

**Input:** `mode` + `commit_message` (validate) or `diff_or_description` (generate) + optional `scope`

**Output:** Pass/fail with issue list (validate), or formatted commit message with type/scope/description (generate)

---

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1 — Foundation (complete)

1. `software-architect` — **DONE** (SKILL.md + 4 references)
2. `data-engineer` — **DONE** (SKILL.md + 2 references)
3. `bclearer-pipeline-architect` — **DONE** (skeleton — 4 references, TODOs to populate)
4. `bclearer-pipeline-engineer` — **DONE** (skeleton — 4 references, TODOs to populate)

### Phase 2 — Core clean coding pair (highest ROI)

5. `clean-code-reviewer` — establishes baseline; other skills build on its output
6. `clean-code-refactor` — acts on reviewer output; completes the detect-and-fix loop

### Phase 3 — High-frequency standalone

7. `clean-code-naming` — high daily use; narrow scope, easy to validate
8. `clean-code-tests` — critical for quality gates; ties into existing testing standards

### Phase 4 — Workflow integration

9. `clean-code-commit` — narrow scope; CI/CD integration point

### Phase 5 — Fill bclearer skeletons (ongoing)

Populate `TODO` items in bclearer reference files as pipeline patterns are confirmed:
- `bclearer-pipeline-architect/references/pipeline-patterns.md`
- `bclearer-pipeline-architect/references/interop-conventions.md`
- `bclearer-pipeline-architect/references/orchestration-conventions.md`
- `bclearer-pipeline-engineer/references/pipeline-implementation.md`

---

## bclearer Pipeline Skills (Tier 2 — Skeletons Created)

### `bclearer-pipeline-architect` — **SKELETON DONE**

Extends `software-architect`. Adds:
- Pipeline topology (4-stage: Ingest / Identify / Transform / Load)
- Additional Design Mode deliverable: Pipeline Stage Map
- Additional Review Mode checklist items (stage separation, interop boundaries, universe scoping)
- bclearer interop service conventions (`references/interop-conventions.md`)
- bclearer orchestration conventions — runner, universe lifecycle (`references/orchestration-conventions.md`)
- Pipeline-specific Confluence page structure

Reference files marked `Status: Skeleton` — populate as pipeline patterns are confirmed from the codebase.

### `bclearer-pipeline-engineer` — **SKELETON DONE**

Extends `data-engineer`. Adds:
- Pipeline code layout convention (`bie/`, `adapters/`, `services/`, `orchestrators/`, `runners/`)
- Construction order for pipelines (common knowledge → BIE objects → adapters → services → orchestrators → runner)
- bclearer code style overrides (backslash continuations, named kwargs, verbose naming, class plurals)
- BIE integration protocol — when to delegate to `bie-data-engineer`, handoff format, identity flow through stages
- Additional verification checklist (stage independence, interop boundary, universe scoping)

Reference files marked `Status: Skeleton` — populate as implementation patterns are confirmed.

## Open Questions

1. **References strategy** — Copy standards into each skill's `references/` dir, or reference the shared `prompts/coding/standards/` path? Current approach: index files in `data-engineer/references/` point to shared path; no duplication.
2. **Refactor output mode** — Should `clean-code-refactor` write changes directly or propose as a diff? Recommendation: default to proposing, with `apply` mode for direct writes.
3. **Phase 2 priority** — `clean-code-reviewer` before or after `clean-code-naming`? Naming has higher daily use but reviewer covers a broader surface area. Recommendation: reviewer first.
